excerpt: I delivered a presentation at the Winnipeg .NET User Group last week, where I recorded it and posted it on YouTube. I go over a number of Microsoft development tools and technologies that don't require Windows and deliver the demos on my Linux machine.

This is a recording of my recent Winnipeg .NET User Group talk about using Microsoft tools without requiring Windows.

It's not the most technical as I go over a ton of topics, at high level, ranging from development tools, to applications. Still, I find this stuff really interesting and hopefully you enjoy it too.
